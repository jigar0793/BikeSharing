# BikeSharing

Overview of the Project

This project uses Tableau to visualize bike trip data from the Citi Bike program in NYC. The final product is an analysis of the data for a business proposal presentation for a similar bike program in Des Moines, Iowa.

The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good business proposal. To demonstrate that through visualization, a bike trips analysis is performed on Citi Bike program data from a similar program in NYC.

There are 4 points in the Tableau story created for the presentation to the investors. They are as follows:

1. This dashboard demonstrates the length of time bikes are checkout out for all riders. It also has a heatmap which shows the number of bike trips for all riders for each hour of each day of the week.

2. In this dashboard we can see the information in the previous dashboard but categorized by gender of the riders. Additionally, it also contains number of bike trips for each user and gender for each day of the week.

3. Here we can look at the peak bike riding hours and the average trip durations of the citi bikes in August in NYC. In the peak hours graph the time between 1:00 a.m to 5:00 a.m. is highlighted as ideal time for bike maintenance since during those hours bike usage is minimal.

4. In this final story point we have a map where the bikes operate which shows the top starting locations of the bike trips. This map helps figure out which areas require more bikes and how much more depepding on different neighborhoods and the type of location.

Summary
The overall story highlights many important considerations for the potential bike-sharing program in Des Moines. Some of the highlights are listed below:

1. We can see from the checkout times graph that most bikes are checked out during early hours of the day and most customers are male. Heatmap also supports this point by showing the usage of male bikers.

2. We can see from the usertype by gender heatmap that most bike users are male subscribers.

3. From the third dashboard, the August peak hours clearly show that the time between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. has the least amount of bike traffic, which makes it an ideal time for bike maintenance.

4. In the same dashboard the average trip duration graphs shows that younger people are using bikes for longer periods of time.

5. Finally, The final story point with the top starting locations give a good idea about what types of locations needs more bikes. Commercial areas and areas where the tourist traffic is higher needs significantly more bikes than residential areas.

Two more visualizations that could be prepared and added for this analysis are:

1. A visualization that shows the total number of rides each bike has accumulated could be a useful tool to determine which ones are due for maintenance.

2. Similar to the top starting locations graph, addind a top ending locations graph could help determine whether the bikes are going to be displaced too far from the starting locations creating scarcity at different starting locations.
